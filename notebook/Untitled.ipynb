Every year, around 8 million people die prematurely as a result of smoking.<a id=\"ref-1\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-1\"><sup>1</sup></a> This means that about one in seven deaths worldwide are due to smoking.<a id=\"ref-2\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> Millions more live in poor health because of it.</p><p>Smoking primarily contributes to early deaths through heart diseases and cancers. Globally, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/smoking#smoking-and-cancer\">more than one in five</a> cancer deaths are attributed to smoking.</p><p>This means tobacco kills more people every day than terrorism kills in a year.<a id=\"ref-3\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>Smoking is a particularly large problem in high-income countries. There, cigarette smoking is the most important cause of preventable disease and death.<a id=\"ref-4\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a> This is especially true for men: they account for almost three-quarters of deaths from smoking.<a id=\"ref-5\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>The impact of smoking is devastating on the individual level. In case you need some motivation to stop smoking: The life expectancy of those who smoke regularly is about <em>10 years</em> lower than that of non-smokers.<a id=\"ref-6\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>It’s also devastating on the aggregate level. In the past 30 years more than 200 million have died from smoking.<a id=\"ref-7\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a> Looking into the future, epidemiologists Prabhat Jha and Richard Peto estimate that “If current smoking patterns persist, tobacco will kill about 1 billion people this century.”<a id=\"ref-8\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>It is on us to prevent this.</p></div><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><div class=\"wp-sticky-container\"></div></div></div><h3 id=\"how-to-make-progress-against-the-millions-of-deaths-from-smoking\">How to make progress against the millions of deaths from smoking?<a class=\"deep-link\" href=\"#how-to-make-progress-against-the-millions-of-deaths-from-smoking\"></a></h3><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right\"><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><h4 id=\"the-most-fundamental-step-is-taken-thanks-to-the-work-of-statisticians-we-know-that-smoking-kills\">The most fundamental step is taken: Thanks to the work of statisticians we know that smoking kills&nbsp;<a class=\"deep-link\" href=\"#the-most-fundamental-step-is-taken-thanks-to-the-work-of-statisticians-we-know-that-smoking-kills\"></a></h4></div><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><div class=\"wp-sticky-container\"></div></div></div><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right\"><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><p>The most fundamental work to prevent millions of deaths is already done. We know that smoking kills.&nbsp;</p><p>This fact is so widely known today that it is hard to imagine that until the middle of the last century nobody was aware of it.<a id=\"ref-9\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>People who do not think well about the work of statisticians sometimes <a href=\"http://notthetreasuryview.blogspot.com/2017/04/spreadsheets-are-people-too-statistics.html\">fall</a> for the idea that statistics are incapable of seeing and understanding the reality that is right in front of our eyes. The impact of smoking is a clear example where the opposite is true – for many decades smokers themselves were entirely blind to the fact that their habit was poisoning and eventually killing them. I have an old mountaineering guide that gives climbers the advice that they should take a pause every now and then during the climb so that they can smoke a cigarette as it “opens up the lungs.” The reality that smoking causes cancer and heart disease became only visible through careful statistical analysis.</p><p>Many of the most important facts are not even visible to those who are impacted by them. Often you need statistics to see what your world actually looks like.<a id=\"ref-10\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a></p></div><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><div class=\"wp-sticky-container\"></div></div></div><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right\"><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><h4 id=\"smoking-seemed-inevitable-until-it-didn-t\">Smoking seemed inevitable until it didn’t<a class=\"deep-link\" href=\"#smoking-seemed-inevitable-until-it-didn-t\"></a></h4></div><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><div class=\"wp-sticky-container\"></div></div></div><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right\"><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><p>The chart summarizes the history of smoking in the US (the development in other high-income countries <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sales-of-cigarettes-per-adult-per-day\">was similar</a>). I plotted two different metrics: in purple you see the rise and fall of cigarette sales, which you can read off the values on the left-hand axis. In red you see the rise and fall of lung cancer deaths, which you can read off the axis on the right.</p><p>Smoking was very much a 20th century problem. It was rare at the beginning of the century, but then – decade after decade – it became steadily more common. By the 1960s it was extremely widespread: on average, American adults were buying more than 10 cigarettes every day.</p><p>The statistical work that identified smoking as the major cause of the rise in lung cancer deaths began in the post-war periods and culminated in the 1964 report of the Surgeon General. This report is seen as a turning point in the history of smoking as it made clear to the public just how deadly it was.<a id=\"ref-11\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>Once people learned that smoking kills, they could act on it. It took some time, but they did.</p><p>I wasn’t alive during peak-smoking, but even I remember how very common it was to smoke in places where it would be unthinkable today. Looking back I also remember how surprised I was by how quickly smoking then declined. It is a good reminder of how wrong it often is to think that things cannot be different –&nbsp;for a long time smoking kept on increasing and it looked as if it would never change. But then it did.</p><p>Nearly half of all former smokers have quit,<a id=\"ref-12\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a> cigarette sales declined to a third of what they once were, and the death rate from lung cancer declined.</p></div><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><div class=\"wp-sticky-container\"><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3048\" height=\"2130\" src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only.png\" alt=\"Smoking and lung cancer mortality us only\" class=\"wp-image-44088\" srcset=\"https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only.png 3048w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only-400x280.png 400w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only-787x550.png 787w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only-150x105.png 150w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only-768x537.png 768w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only-1536x1073.png 1536w, https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only-2048x1431.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3048px) 100vw, 3048px\" data-high-res-src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/07/Smoking-and-lung-cancer-mortality-US-only.png\"></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right\"><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><h4 id=\"the-global-perspective-people-in-poor-countries-are-not-following-the-path\">The global perspective: people in poor countries are not following the path<a class=\"deep-link\" href=\"#the-global-perspective-people-in-poor-countries-are-not-following-the-path\"></a></h4></div><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><div class=\"wp-sticky-container\"></div></div></div><div class=\"wp-block-columns is-style-sticky-right\"><div class=\"wp-block-column\"><p>For some time it looked as if people in poorer countries followed the path of people in richer countries.

If you are fascinated by the risk-taking of climbers like Reinhold Messner or Alex Honnold, that’s nothing compared to what smokers are willing to do.</p><p>The devastation caused by smoking today is still terrible.

Studies show that those who stop smoking in the first four or five decades of their life do not suffer from elevated mortality risks.<a id=\"ref-17\" class=\"ref\" href=\"#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a> But the benefits from smoking cessation are large at any age.</p><p>We can win the fight against smoking. Among the largest problems in the world it is one where I feel most certain that we can achieve a lot of progress. Thanks to the statisticians we have the scientific knowledge to know about its consequences; we know that the public health campaigns work; and we can appeal to peoples’ self-interest to not shorten their lifespan by 10 years.</p><p>Or more positively, we can appeal to peoples’ self-interest to live 10 more years of their life!</p><p>The share of the world population that is following this crippling path is falling.

The report of the US Surgeon General’s first Smoking and Health in 1964 is seen as the landmark report that made it known to a wide public that smoking cigarettes has dangerous health effects, including lung cancer and heart disease. Some other pioneers – like Pearl in Baltimore – presented evidence even earlier (late 30s), but a consensus was only established much later.</p></li><li id=\"note-10\"><p>Smoking isn’t the only case where the negative impact of a practice wasn’t seen until statisticians made them visible. It also feels obvious to us today that basic hygiene is key to staying healthy, but until the late 19th century even doctors were entirely unaware of the importance of hygiene – it was common practice to deliver babies right after performing autopsies without the doctors washing their hands in between. The widespread lack of hygiene was one of the main causes of maternal mortality and countless children lost their mother right in the moment she gave birth to them.<br>See my article on Ignaz Semmelweis and the history of maternal mortality – Roser (2017) <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/measurement-matters-the-decline-of-maternal-mortality\">Measurement Matters – The decline of maternal mortality</a> on Our World in Data.</p></li><li id=\"note-11\"><p>See U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2014) – <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179276/\">The Health Consequences of Smoking – 50 Years of Progress</a>.

The report of the US Surgeon General’s first Smoking and Health in 1964 is seen as the landmark report that made it known to a wide public that smoking cigarettes has dangerous health effects, including lung cancer and heart disease. Some other pioneers – like Pearl in Baltimore – presented evidence even earlier (late 30s), but a consensus was only established much later.\n",
